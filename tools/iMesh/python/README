PyTAPS

== Installation ==

PyTAPS requires the following to be installed on your system:
 * Python (2.2+)
 * Numpy
 * MOAB (or other iBase/iMesh interface)
 * HDF5

If the include files and libraries are in the default paths for your C 
compiler, then typing `python setup.py install' should be sufficient. If not,
create a file named `setup.cfg' and enter the appropriate paths, like so:

----- Begin setup.cfg -----

[build_ext]
include_dirs = folder1:folder2
library_dirs = folder3:folder4

----- End setup.cfg -----


== Usage ==

For usage examples, consult the files in test/*. For help with using the iMesh
interface, run `help(itaps.iMesh)' from the Python interpreter.


== Testing ==

Basic tests of the interface may be run from test/. To run all tests (excluding
iterator tests), run all.py. If the tests fail to import the package properly,
consult test/core.py and adjust the sys.path setting as needed.
