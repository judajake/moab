A MOAB reader plugin for VTK/Paraview.  To build:
- download and build Paraview from www.paraview.org
- run 'ccmake .'; point MOAB_DIR to the MOAB install location, and ParaView_DIR to
  THE PARAVIEW BUILD DIRECTORY (NOT the ParaView source directory); specifically, this is
  the directory containing the ParaViewConfig.cmake file.  Configure, then generate.
- run make; this should compile a 'libvtkMOABReader.so' shared library file, which serves
  as a ParaView plugin
- to read into ParaView, select Tools->Manage Plugins, then "Load New...", pointing it at
  the libvtkMOABReader.so file; to read that plugin every time you start ParaView, expand
  the '+' next to the plugin name and check the "Auto Load" box
- you should now be able to read files using MOAB

Note, this viewer can also view geometric models, at least from the CGM OCC engine; to use,
build CGM/OCC as shared libraries, link to them from MOAB (with the --with-cgm= configure
option), and build the vtk viewer as before, but pointing to the CGM-ized MOAB.
